## Modifications that need to be made to use Dotfiles

- For Paru I use a custom pacman.conf which is hardcoded to my user directory, change this in ~/.config/paru/paru.conf
- Other changes which I might not have noted here, please don't just copy some random persons dotfiles and expect them to work.
